## Description

I've been tasked with making a README file generator using inquirer.

## Installation

```
npm init -y
npm install inquirer
```

## Usage

When run, a user is prompted with questions, the user has to fill out answers which are stored.
Doing this generates a readme file which uses information from the questions answered.
Too make a professional looking README.md and the file is generated.
